## ARPanet

Precurser to the modern internet

Test of tech called packet-switching, breaks data into small packets.

Allows researchers to use external computer resources.

### International ARPanet

Went international. Grew to 40 nodes via satellite

Email invented by Ray Tomlinson using @ symbol

### ARPanet growing

Second decade saw growth to 100 nodes.
Only used by researchers and techies

### HOSTS.TXT

Computers needed numeric addresses.
ARPanet had no distributed hostname system.

File called HOSTS.TXT was manually maintained, but didn't scale well

Local IP networks became popular
DNS was used for WAN

## Arpanet becomes internet

Centralized network would be too big.
Distributed network using TCP/IP standards
AKA: Network of networks
Multiple LANs communicated over a WAN using shared standards.

Allowed for faster network growth

## NSFNET

First internet backbone.
Still largely academic
World Wide Web app was created

## Creation of global network

Expanded from United States
Graph theory is a good visualization of network intercommunication.

US dominates internet via [preferential attachment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preferential_attachment) and [power law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_law)

1994, Clinton administration contributed to privatization of the internet.

## Modern internet backbone

Massive fiber bundles running across ocean.
Fun fact: We have not yet reached the capacity of our oceanic fiber backbone.

Fixing of broadband penetration via mobile broadband penetration.

Amount of people online outside of US has increased significantly, especially in India and China.

Rural areas tend to lean mobile due to lack of physical cable infrastructure.

User data is most likely stored in corporate datacenters. Likely Seattle.

Covid caused the amount of online users to skyrocket.
