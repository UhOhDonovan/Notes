# Questions

Clarification on the OSI model:

- Is it correct that lower level links need to be established before higher level layers can be executed?
- Is it correct that routers in the netwokr layer create links by changing the packet to the destination of the next jump?
- Does the TCP/UDP layer need a response from the ip layer before it can establish a connection?
