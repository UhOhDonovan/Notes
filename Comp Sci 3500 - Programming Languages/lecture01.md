## Historical Perspective

### Why Programming Languages?

- Machines were big, problems small.
  - Programs used machine code. Sets of punch cards that fed it bytes.
- '53 John Backus IBM: Automated translator
  - Eliminate bugs
  - Programmers are more productive
  - I will take six months
- '60s:
  - Algol-60
    - Attempt at a universal language format
    - Description is in "Backus-Naur form"
  - COBOL: `ADD A TO B PRODUCING C` designed for businessmen
  - IBM PL/1: Did not go over well
  - Algol-68: A very modern language that no one used
    - A ton of features that modern languages boast
    - So complex that no one could create a complete compiler
    - Algol-W: Subset of 68 that got an actual compiler
  - Functional languages started to appear:
    - Lisp developed by John McCarthy
- '70s:
