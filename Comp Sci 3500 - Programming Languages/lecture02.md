# Programming Language Implementation

## How are they implemented?

- Compiled
- Interpreted
- Hybrid (both)

Objective: Create a way to convert source code to machine code.

Machine code is "relatively" simple:

- fetch data from memory
- Store data from cpu into memory
- Perform operations on two values on cpu (Add, subtract, multiply, etc)
- Move, change, or modify instruction pointer to skip or repeat instructions
