## Perceptrons

Perceptron: Single boolean output based on several weighted binary inputs.

- The output (0 | 1) is determined by a weighted sum of all inputs plus a bias is greater than zero.
- Inputs (x~n~) are binary inputs.
- Weights (w~n~) are real numbers assigned to each input that express the importance of that input.
- The Bias (b) is a value added to the weighted sum to increase the chance of the perceptron being greater than zero.
